Channel bonding:
  OSI Layer 1
  Example: A wifi AP combining adjacent channels in a band of frequincies
  increasing throughput.
  Channel bonding can also be applied to ethernet and is called NIC bonding.
  
Link agregation:
  OSI Layer 2
  


load ballencing
  Load balencing works from the modem to your servers
  and splits the load of incoming requests between many servers so it is shared between them.

network bonding(?)
bonded networks must have the same IP on both sides of the connection, 
so if you have two modems the ip must be the same on the ISP side for both.

To combine the speeds of two or more uplinks this might be the way.
