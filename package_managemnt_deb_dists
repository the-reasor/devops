# Sometimes you might get an error like:
# "Waiting for cache lock: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend. It is held by process 3504 (unattended-upgr)"
# The error should say the Process ID (or PID), in this case 3504
# and you can use that number to terminate the process.
# Run this to kill the process
sudo kill -9 process_id

# NOTE: despite this error unattended upgrade is a good feature and helps keep your packages up to date
# and less vulnerable without you having to actively update the packages yourself.
