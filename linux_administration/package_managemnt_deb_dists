#### Linux (Linux Is Not UNix = LINUX)
#To simplify things I have relabled this to deb dists, since I plan on documenting other distrobutions
# and because Deb/Deb based operating systems have several package management solutions.
# Most common examples of Deb systems are Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Raspbian.
# but most lightweight and specific purpose OSes are built based on Debian.
# Some examples are Kali linux and Parrot Security OS for pentesting,
# Tails OS and Whonix for privacy
# Steam OS for gaming (I will probably do a repo on linux gaming as well)
# and MANY if not most smart devices use Debian as their base.
# Some interesting examples of Debian include ARMbian and Mobian, for ARM and mobile platforms respectively.


# using apt
# install without being asked
sudo apt -y install package_name

# Sometimes you might get an error like:
# "Waiting for cache lock: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend. It is held by process 3504 (unattended-upgr)"
# The error should say the Process ID (or PID), in this case 3504
# and you can use that number to terminate the process.
# Run this to kill the process
sudo kill -9 process_id

# NOTE: despite this error unattended upgrade is a good feature and helps keep your packages up to date
# and less vulnerable without you having to actively update the packages yourself.
